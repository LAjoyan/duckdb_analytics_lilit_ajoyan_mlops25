## 📘 About
This repository contains lecture code, experiments, and exercises created while learning **analytics with DuckDB, SQL, and Python**.

The learning journey starts with using **DuckDB’s UI** to explore SQL concepts, then progresses to **connecting DuckDB with Python**, working with **pandas DataFrames**, and finally building simple **data pipelines with dlt** and a **frontend using Evidence**.

This is a learning-focused repository, not a production project.

## 🧠 What This Repository Covers
The material is structured as code-alongs and exercises covering:

- SQL fundamentals in DuckDB
- Querying and filtering data
- CRUD operations
- Grouping and aggregations
- String and set operations
- Joins
- Using DuckDB via the DuckDB UI
- Connecting to DuckDB from Python
- Executing SQL from Python scripts
- Loading SQL files into DuckDB
- Converting query results to pandas DataFrames
- Basic data transformations using dlt
- Building a simple analytics frontend with Evidence
